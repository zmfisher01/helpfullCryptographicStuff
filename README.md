# README

## Install
You can run each file locally, copy and paste it into [sagecell](https://sagecell.sagemath.org/) or make a notebook.  
*I* should've made it a notebook, but it doesn't really matter.

## What's included?
So far we've got:
 - **barretreduction.sage** which is Modular Reduction with the Barrett Reduction method
 - **modexp.sage** which is Modular Exponentiation using the Square and Multiply method
 - **modinv_flt.sage** which is Modular Inversion using Fermat's Little Theorem
 - **modinv_eea.sage** which is Modular Inversion using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm
 - **exam2020/question3.sage** which is a sagemath solution to the 2020 exam's Elliptic Curve Question

## Quirks
The structure of the sagemath files are **very inconsistent** because some of the code was written during different time periods. So **beware**.
